--- Structs ---

    - A structure array is a data type that groups related data using data containers
      called fields.

    - Data from each field can be accessed using structName.fieldName

    - Importing data from a file can be returned as a scalar structure array depending
      on the characteristics of the file. This structure array can take on the following
      fields:

          -> data
          -> textdata - includes colheaders and rowheaders
          -> colheaders
          -> rowheaders
