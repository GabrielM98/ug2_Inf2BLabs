    >> [tmp, ridx] = sort(V, 1, 'descend')

    - Sorts the matrix V in descending order by the 1st dim. Tmp is the sorted out
      matrix and ridx specifies the order in which each element is rearranged.

    >> V = V(ridx)

    - Creates a new matrix V from the existing matrix V by extracting the elements
      specified in the vector ridx.

    - Bear in mind that the row vector ridx extracts the elements that correspond
      to the indices of the matrix in the first dimension. This dimension goes
      vertically (rows), like so...

      1 3
      2 4

    - So the indices of each element in the 1st dim correspond with the elements
      in this 2x2 matrix.

    - Note however that you cannot extract elements in 2 dimensions by specifying
      a vector.
