--- More notes on plotting ---

    - After creating a figure it is possible to add some properties

    >> axis([-1, 11, -1, 11])

    - Sets the axis limits for x and y

    >> xlabel('Movie 4')

    - Sets the label for the x axis, same can be done for y axis

    >> hold on

    - Allows us to then add another plot on top of the figure we have already created

--- Adding labels to data points ---

    - Let's say you have a list of 3 movies...

    >> a = {'M1','M2','M3'}

    - The labels are given in a 1x3 cell array

    >> dx = 0.1; dy = 0.3;
    >> text(x+dx, y+dy, a);

    - Adds the cell array item corresponding to each data point.

    - The displacement is given so that the text does not overlay the
      data points

-- Adding legend ---

    - This is done in a similar way to labels

    >> data_names = {'Cr 1', 'Cr 2', 'Cr 3'}
    >> legend(data_names, 'Location','southeast')

    - Legend is created using labels from data_names cell array. The 2nd and 3rd argument indicate
      the location of the legend on the graph.
