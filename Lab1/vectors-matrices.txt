--- Intro to Matlab ---

    >> help power

    - Returns what function does.

    >> who

    - Displays list of variables in workspace

--- Vectors  ---

    - An array is simply a row vector, in order to create a column vector use
      the tranpose operator '

    - Alternatively you can break columns up using a semi-colon like so...

      v = [5 0; 2 1]

    - The above would be a 2x2 matrix. Where 5 0 would be the first row.

    - Useful vector operations:
        -> dot(v,w)
        -> cross(v,w)
        -> norm(v)

--- Matrices ---

    - The transpose operator ' also works on matrices.

    - Useful matrix operations:
        -> inv(a)
        -> det(a)
        -> norm(a)
        -> sum(a) % computes the sum of each col
        -> mean(a) % computes the mean of each col

    >> size(m)

    - Will return the size of the matrix in rows and columns. So in this case 2 2.
      Using a second argument such as size(m,1) will give you the size of the matrix
      in terms of rows.

    >> eye(3,2)

    - Will create a 3x2 identity matrix. A zero matrix can be created in a similiar
      fashion using the command "zero(r,c)". You can also create a ones matrix.

    >> m.*n

    - Multiplies m by n element-wise. As if m is 3x3 and n is 2x3 matrix multiplication
      would not be possible.

    >> m(2,3)

    - Returns the i,jth element of the matrix m.

    >> m(2:3,1:2)

    - Selects a sub matrix containing rows 2 and 3 and cols 1 and 2. A colon on its own
      selects all rows (or cols)

    >> reshape(m,1,9)

    - Reshapes matrix (or vector) m to have r rows and c columns

    >> repmat(mu, R, C)

    - Replicates the vector mu as a new matrix of size RxC
