--- Plotting graphs ---

    >> x = (1:0.01:5);
    >> plot(x, sin(x*pi))

    - Plots a set of points from 1 to 5 with spacing .01 on the x axis and the
      sin(x*pi) on the y axis. Adding a third argument can be used to specify
      line colour and style.    

    Other useful commands:
        -> title()
        -> xlabel()
        -> ylabel()
        -> legend()
